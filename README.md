# Runescape Grand Exchange Web Scrapper
A Python 3.7 webscrapper script that grabs information from Runescape Service and  Runescape Wiki to get daily prices and alchemy profits. The script will grab the prices of items based on items listed in a text file and outputs another file with the latest information of prices based on the user requests.

- [RS Grand Exchange API Request](http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/api/catalogue/detail.json?item=)

## Bugs
